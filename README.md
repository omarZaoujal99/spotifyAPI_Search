# spotifyAPI_Search
The goal of this project is to learn how to work with API, it was my first time handling with an API in node.js, using express.js module, axios library, and http requests.

I learned how the API works in gener, how I can get the data from the client side to the server, or the opposite, also how I learned a little bit about postman platform, how I should test my http requests and how I can test API in there...
